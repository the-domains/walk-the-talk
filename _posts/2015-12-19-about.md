# Brian Wilson

Brian Wilson is conservative entrepreneur and business owner. Originally from Buffalo, NY, Brian moved to Las Vegas in 1995 with his wife Valerie to escape a crumbling economy being crushed under the weight of big government and high taxes. Brian's desire to restore Nevada to the low tax, small government values that drew him here in 1995 led him to work as a policy director for Michele in the Nevada Legislature.
