# Brian Wilson

Brian Wilson is conservative entrepreneur and business owner. Originally from Buffalo, NY, Brian moved to Las Vegas in 1995 with his wife Valerie to escape a crumbling economy being crushed under the weight of big government and high taxes. Brian's desire to restore Nevada to the smaller government/lower taxes values that drew him here in 1995 led him to work as a policy director for Michele in the Nevada Legislature.
